JavaScript Exercises and programs

This repo is a collection of JavaScript programs I've written whilst working through various books.
I'm currently learning JavaScript and will provide a list of the books I'm currently reading, or have read, in this readme file. I will also include the book and exercise number for the associated exercise for each program within the file. I will not however provide the exercise text, but will instead provide a description of the program and details for how you can find the associated exercise.
