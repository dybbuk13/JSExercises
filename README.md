JavaScript Exercises and programs

This repo is a collection of JavaScript programs I've written whilst working through various books.
I'm currently learning JavaScript and will provide a list of books within this readme file. I will also
include the book and exercise number for the associated exercise for each program (within the main file if
an exercise requires multiple files). I will not however provide the exercise text, but will instead provide
a description of the program and details for how you can find and work the associated exercise.
